## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark, muted blue (#34495E) to convey professionalism and trust, without being overly formal. This color represents stability and depth.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F2F5), nearly white, to maintain a clean, modern, and spacious feel.
- Accent color: A vibrant, saturated orange (#E67E22) for calls to action and highlights, creating a strong contrast and drawing user attention. The orange provides an element of energy to encourage interaction.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', sans-serif. Body font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif. Use Poppins for a contemporary, precise feel, and PT Sans for readability in longer texts.
- Use a consistent set of professional, minimalist icons throughout the application to aid navigation and quickly communicate functionality.
- Employ a modern and clean layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive design and consistent alignment of elements. Use cards to display lead information and forms with visual validation.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and loading animations to provide visual feedback and enhance user experience. Ensure all interactive elements provide clear states for hover, active, and disabled.
